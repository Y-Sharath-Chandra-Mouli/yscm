	<strong>Title:</strong> A Comprehensive Micromechanics based Damage-Inelasticity Model for Univerection Composites<br> 
	<strong>Project Overview:</strong> </p1><br>
	The last few decades have seen significant potential for fiber-reinforced polymer matrix unidirectional composites as an alternative to conventional metals in aerospace structures. The demand for better structural materials is continuously emerging in response to the increasing performance requirements of modern aircraft. Aircraft structures commonly experience cyclic loads, which can gradually accumulate damage, leading to component failure. Understanding the underlying deformation mechanisms, damage initiation, and damage growth is vital for the predictive analysis of laminated composites. A large number of ply-level continuum damage mechanics-based models exist in the literature. However, these damage models can not explain how the constituent deformation and damage manifest in the ply-level behavior. In recent years, micromechanics based modeling has emerged as a reliable tool for understanding the damage initiation and growth paths in constituents. However, the constitutive models that bridge the micromechanics based modeling and ply-level continuum damage still need to be modeled. The present thesis presents a systematic methodology that bridges the constituent damage onto the ply-level constitutive model for unidirectional composites. The main objective of this thesis is to understand the influence of elastic fiber and coupled damage-inelasticity behavior of matrix on unidirectional composites through micromechanics based multiscale constitutive modeling. Further, to develop a ply-level continuum mechanics-based coupled damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional composites with an application to quasi-static and low-velocity impact analysis.
