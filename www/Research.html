	<strong>Title:</strong> A Comprehensive Micromechanics based Damage-Inelasticity Model for Univerection Composites<br> 
	<strong>Synopsis:</strong> </p1><br>
	<p1>The last few decades have seen significant potential for fiber-reinforced polymer matrix unidirectional composites as an alternative to conventional metals in aerospace structures. The demand for better structural materials is continuously emerging in response to the increasing performance requirements of modern aircraft. Aircraft structures commonly experience cyclic loads, which can gradually accumulate damage, leading to component failure. Understanding the underlying deformation mechanisms, damage initiation, and damage growth is vital for the predictive analysis of laminated composites. A large number of ply-level continuum damage mechanics-based models exist in the literature. However, these damage models can not explain how the constituent deformation and damage manifest in the ply-level behavior. In recent years, micromechanics based modeling has emerged as a reliable tool for understanding the damage initiation and growth paths in constituents. However, the constitutive models that bridge the micromechanics based modeling and ply-level continuum damage still need to be modeled. The present thesis presents a systematic methodology that bridges the constituent damage onto the ply-level constitutive model for unidirectional composites. The main objective of this thesis is to understand the influence of elastic fiber and coupled damage-inelasticity behavior of matrix on unidirectional composites through micromechanics based multiscale constitutive modeling. Further, to develop a ply-level continuum mechanics-based coupled damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional composites with an application to quasi-static and low-velocity impact analysis.<br>
	Damage mechanisms in laminated composites can broadly be categorized as Intra-ply (damage mechanisms within the ply) and Inter-ply (damage due to delamination between the plies) damage mechanisms. Intra-ply damage mechanisms can be categorized into fiber and inter-fiber (matrix) modes. The fiber behavior dominates fiber mode. Inter-fiber mode is dominated by matrix behavior. This thesis does not consider the Inter-fiber mode due to the fiber-matrix interface. Nevertheless, matrix mode is critical as the sizing of fibers forms an interphase between fiber and matrix, enhancing the fiber-matrix interface bonding. In summary, modeling of damage onset, growth of inelasticity, and damage in constituent (fiber and matrix) modes within the ply and delamination damage mode between the plies can give a clear understanding of laminated composite behavior. This thesis presents a systematic micromechanics based methodology to bridge the constituent level deformation and damage mechanisms to the directional-dependent deformation and damage mechanisms of laminated composites.<br>
	This thesis is presented in five sub-parts: (i) Elastic analysis on representative volume element (RVE): Validation of standard mechanics approach for the computation of effective properties and to propose a generalized micromechanics based damage initiation model for unidirectional composites. (ii) Constitutive modeling of a coupled damage-inelastic constitutive model for matrix. (iii) Micromechanics of unit cell RVE: Validation of three-dimensional (3D) periodic macro strain boundary conditions for prediction of transverse isotropic elastic properties of composite with minimal RVE size, validation of perfect bond assumption for damage onset model and validation of periodic macro stress boundary conditions and to compute the effect of fiber volume fraction with damage-inelastic behavior of matrix on the ply-level constitutive behavior of the composite. (iv) Identification of bridging parameters from micromechanical analysis: Loading-unloading of unit cell RVE for ply-level invariant stresses to obtain the bridging parameters and to develop a continuum mechanics based coupled damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional composites (V) Review of ply-level continuum damage models for impact analysis and demonstration of quasi-static three-point bending case using the proposed multiscale damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional laminated composites. A detailed summary of the above five part are presented in the following paragraphs.<br>
	In the first study of the thesis, four sets of 3D periodic RVEs, each with 50 randomly distributed fibers from the literature, are considered for the elastic micromechanical analysis. The standard-mechanics mechanics based on Hill’s concentration factors approach with uniform displacement boundary conditions is used to obtain the effective properties of the ply-level composite. Further, the first study presents a micromechanics-based damage initiation model for ply-level composite. The local state of stress is used to measure the damage stress concentration factor (DSCF), which is an indicator of the damageability of the material. The distribution of DSCF is used to identify the critical damage initiation regions (CDIRs). Averaged stress concentration factors over CDIRs are used to develop a macro-level damage initiation model. Notably, the study consistently connects the damage initiation in the composite to the constituent damage initiation properties through the micromechanics framework with a specific distribution of fibers in the RVE. Finally, this part of the study uses the proposed damage initiation model to present the stress interaction curves for damage initiation and the scatter in the damage initiation envelopes.<br>
	In the second study of the thesis, a thermodynamically consistent coupled damage-inelastic constitutive model for epoxy is presented. The study introduces an asymmetric von Mises yield criterion for varying hydrostatic stress dependence in tension and compression. Damage in the material is defined as a three-dimensional entity. i.e., the damage is assumed as a spherical void in the cubical representative volume element (RVE). An explicit stiffness reduction model is presented using micromechanical analysis of void-based RVE. A two-step radial return method with an associative flow rule, coupled with damage growth, is developed for the evolution of inelastic strains. The proposed model is implemented in a user material UMAT subroutine and integrated into the commercial solver ABAQUS\textsuperscript{TM}. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated by comparing its predictions with the material data available in the literature. Further, an experimental investigation is carried out on an in-house epoxy, and the proposed model is used to capture the tensile and compression behavior. Eventually, the model is intended to be applied for the micromechanical analysis of unidirectional composites to predict the macro response and to develop a ply-level continuum damage-inelasticity model with an application to quasi-static loading and low-velocity impact analysis as mentioned in the main objective of the thesis.<br>
	The third study of the thesis presents 3D periodic macro strain and stress boundary conditions for the micromechanical analysis of an RVE with a diamond-shaped fiber arrangement. The periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are often preferred over uniform boundary conditions when performing micromechanical analyses for several reasons. Geometric periodicity accompanied by periodic mesh and boundary conditions represents the realistic periodic nature of the composite microstructure. On the other hand, edge effects are induced due to uniform boundary conditions necessitating considering a larger periodic domain. In view of computation cost, in this part of the study, 3D periodic macro strain and stress boundary conditions are implemented on a minimalistic RVE with a diamond-shaped fiber arrangement (considered as unit cell RVE) using the Python script in ABAQUS\textsuperscript{TM}. Macro strain periodic boundary conditions are validated by computing the effective properties of the unidirectional composite at the ply level. However, obtaining transverse isotropy in the effective properties with regular engineering/pure transverse shear boundary conditions overestimates transverse shear modulus. The thesis proposes alternate transverse shear boundary conditions to accurately predict effective properties that preserve the transverse isotropy of composite unit cell RVE. Further, the perfect bond assumption in the damage onset model is validated by considering the thin interphase layer in the unit cell RVE and perturbing the center fiber at various positions. The possible maximum values of local DSCFs of interphase are obtained as less than that of the matrix. That indicates that the damage initiates on the matrix first, and considering only the matrix and fiber modes for damage initiation is a reasonable choice. Furthermore, using the periodic macro stress boundary conditions, the effect of varied fiber volume fraction with damage-inelastic behavior of matrix on the effective constitutive behavior of the ply-level composite behavior is demonstrated.<br>
	Once the micromechanical framework is validated in the third study, the next study presents the methodology to identify bridging parameters to scale the micro constituent damage entities to the continuum ply-level damage. In the present study, the phased volume averaged value of the matrix damage variable is chosen as the bridging parameter. The RVE volume average entities are obtained for the four basic matrix-dominated invariant load cases through virtual testing of unit cell RVE. The unloading cases at different strain loads are also carried out for each invariant load case to evaluate the unloading slope and ply-level inelastic strains. A continuum mechanics-based coupled damage-inelasticity model for ply-level unidirectional composites is developed and implemented as a UMAT subroutine in ABAQUS\textsuperscript{TM}. The ply-level damage model meets the virtual testing stress-strain curves of the composite. It infers that the phased volume averaged matrix damage can be used as a bridging entity to model the macro behavior of unidirectional composites.<br>		
	The fifth study of the thesis is subdivided into three sections. In the first section, a review of 3D Hashin failure criteria and damage meso-level (DML) models for the low-velocity impact analysis of laminated composites is carried out. In this work section, a cross-ply laminate of dimensions 80 x 80 x 2.1 mm with stacking sequence [0/90/0/90/0] is subjected to impact by a rigid impactor of mass 6.5 kgs. The finite element simulation used perfectly elastic, 3-D Hashin damage, and 3-D Damage meso-level (3-D DML) models. Fiber and matrix failure modes are considered in both the damage models. User subroutine (VUMAT) was implemented for damage models, and analysis was carried out on ABAQUS\textsuperscript{TM}. The force and displacement-time response are computed at 5J and 10J of impact energies. The effect of damage models on force and displacement-time response with change in impact energy are presented. Comparing the maximum forces and displacement-time response, the 3D DML model shows close agreement. In contrast, the 3D Hashin model under-predicts the maximum force and over-predicts the maximum displacement with the literature. In the second section of this study, the low-velocity impact behavior of composite laminate made of in-house prepreg is studied. Epoxy resin and carbon fibers were used to prepare the In-house prepregs. The composite laminates are compression moulded at 0.7 MPa using a hot press of 10 kN, and impact specimens are prepared intact with the dimensions in ASTM D7136. The impact tests are conducted on Instron CEAST 9340 with a hemispherical tup of diameter 16mm as the impactor. The size of the damage area due to the impact test is identified using a phased array scanner. Finite element modeling and simulation of the low-velocity impact is carried out by exploiting the 3D Hashin damage model. A preliminary study is carried out to understand the effectiveness of the Hashin 3D damage model in predicting the damage area due to low-velocity impact on laminate prepared by in-house prepregs. However, the above predictions are carried out with intra-ply damage mechanisms without delamination. In the third section of this study, the matrix model implemented in the third study of the thesis is used as a thin layer of interface between the plies, and the continuum-based coupled damage-inelasticity model is used for ply and a three-point bending model is demonstrated to emphasize the versatility of the proposed micromechanics based multiscale damage-inelasticity constitutive model for unidirectional composite.</p1><br>
