	<strong>Title:</strong> A Comprehensive Micromechanics based Damage-Inelasticity Model for Univerection Composites<br> 
	<strong>Synopsis:</strong> </p1><br>
	The last few decades have seen significant potential for fiber-reinforced polymer matrix unidirectional composites as an alternative to conventional metals in aerospace structures. The demand for better structural materials is continuously emerging in response to the increasing performance requirements of modern aircraft. Aircraft structures commonly experience cyclic loads, which can gradually accumulate damage, leading to component failure. Understanding the underlying deformation mechanisms, damage initiation, and damage growth is vital for the predictive analysis of laminated composites. A large number of ply-level continuum damage mechanics-based models exist in the literature. However, these damage models can not explain how the constituent deformation and damage manifest in the ply-level behavior. In recent years, micromechanics based modeling has emerged as a reliable tool for understanding the damage initiation and growth paths in constituents. However, the constitutive models that bridge the micromechanics based modeling and ply-level continuum damage still need to be modeled. The present thesis presents a systematic methodology that bridges the constituent damage onto the ply-level constitutive model for unidirectional composites. The main objective of this thesis is to understand the influence of elastic fiber and coupled damage-inelasticity behavior of matrix on unidirectional composites through micromechanics based multiscale constitutive modeling. Further, to develop a ply-level continuum mechanics-based coupled damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional composites with an application to quasi-static and low-velocity impact analysis. </p1><br>
	Damage mechanisms in laminated composites can broadly be categorized as Intra-ply (damage mechanisms within the ply) and Inter-ply (damage due to delamination between the plies) damage mechanisms. Intra-ply damage mechanisms can be categorized into fiber and inter-fiber (matrix) modes. The fiber behavior dominates fiber mode. Inter-fiber mode is dominated by matrix behavior. This thesis does not consider the Inter-fiber mode due to the fiber-matrix interface. Nevertheless, matrix mode is critical as the sizing of fibers forms an interphase between fiber and matrix, enhancing the fiber-matrix interface bonding. In summary, modeling of damage onset, growth of inelasticity, and damage in constituent (fiber and matrix) modes within the ply and delamination damage mode between the plies can give a clear understanding of laminated composite behavior. This thesis presents a systematic micromechanics based methodology to bridge the constituent level deformation and damage mechanisms to the directional-dependent deformation and damage mechanisms of laminated composites. </p1><br>
	This thesis is presented in five sub-parts: (i) Elastic analysis on representative volume element (RVE): Validation of standard mechanics approach for the computation of effective properties and to propose a generalized micromechanics based damage initiation model for unidirectional composites. (ii) Constitutive modeling of a coupled damage-inelastic constitutive model for matrix. (iii) Micromechanics of unit cell RVE: Validation of three-dimensional (3D) periodic macro strain boundary conditions for prediction of transverse isotropic elastic properties of composite with minimal RVE size, validation of perfect bond assumption for damage onset model and validation of periodic macro stress boundary conditions and to compute the effect of fiber volume fraction with damage-inelastic behavior of matrix on the ply-level constitutive behavior of the composite. (iv) Identification of bridging parameters from micromechanical analysis: Loading-unloading of unit cell RVE for ply-level invariant stresses to obtain the bridging parameters and to develop a continuum mechanics based coupled damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional composites (V) Review of ply-level continuum damage models for impact analysis and demonstration of quasi-static three-point bending case using the proposed multiscale damage-inelasticity model for unidirectional laminated composites. A detailed summary of the above five part are presented in the following paragraphs. </p1><br>
	In the first study of the thesis, four sets of 3D periodic RVEs, each with 50 randomly distributed fibers from the literature, are considered for the elastic micromechanical analysis. The standard-mechanics mechanics based on Hill’s concentration factors approach with uniform displacement boundary conditions is used to obtain the effective properties of the ply-level composite. Further, the first study presents a micromechanics-based damage initiation model for ply-level composite. The local state of stress is used to measure the damage stress concentration factor (DSCF), which is an indicator of the damageability of the material. The distribution of DSCF is used to identify the critical damage initiation regions (CDIRs). Averaged stress concentration factors over CDIRs are used to develop a macro-level damage initiation model. Notably, the study consistently connects the damage initiation in the composite to the constituent damage initiation properties through the micromechanics framework with a specific distribution of fibers in the RVE. Finally, this part of the study uses the proposed damage initiation model to present the stress interaction curves for damage initiation and the scatter in the damage initiation envelopes.
